# Bike-Share-Project
First Project

Code reads in a csv and provides interactive experience which allows the user to answer questions about the data such as: most popular times of travel, popular stations and most popular round trip, total trip durations, and user info (counts of each user type, counts of each gender, etc).

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities (Chicago, New York City, and Washington) in the csv. All three of the data files contain the same core six (6) columns:

Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57),
End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53),
Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776),
Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave),
End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave),
User Type (Subscriber or Customer),

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
Gender,
Birth Year
